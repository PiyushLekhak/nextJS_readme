# Career Goals

I'm interested in **Data Science** because it's full of surprises. I don't always know what I'll discover, and that's what increases my curiosity. I love digging into data and finding insights that are not expected.

While I may not have a specific goal in mind, I am driven by a clear purpose: to leverage my skills in Data Science to make a meaningful impact. I aspire to collaborate with a forward-thinking organization, where I can contribute towards its growth and improvement through data-driven strategies and solutions.

# Career Goals

My Personal Planned RoadMap (Please advise if any of these are outdated or if there are emerging trends I should consider):

1. Maths: (statistics, probability, calculus)
2. Programming Languages: Python with core focus on basic libraries (numpy, pandas, matplotlib,etc) as well as ml libraries(sklearn, tensorflow,Keras,etc). Also been recently looking at frameworks like langchain for llm.
3. Databases: at least one relational and one non relational.
4. Big Data/ External Data Visualization tools like Tableau, Excel, Hadoop, etc.
5. Learn web scraping to extract data from websites.

While it is not possible to integrate all these elements into a single project, this is just my plan to outline the areas I aim to learn in the future. I already have some familiarity with Python, SQL, sklearn, etc to some extent.
